                so this should be a fairly bland and uninformative section.  If 
                has actually read this far, let me know in class.  I carry wintagreen 
                lifesavers with me and I will share one with you.  Cheers.<br><br>

                Since the example had to paragraphs, I will mirror that here, since 
                the rest of this assignment looks like a dumpster fire at this point.  
                And not a clean one either, like outside a paper plant.  We are talking a 
                medical waste 4 alarm dumpster fire.  Gross.
